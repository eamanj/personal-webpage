I am an assistant professor of Information Technologies at University of Maryland Business
school. Previously, I was a postdoctoral associate at UC Berkeley department of Statistics
until January 2024.  I received a dual PhD in [Social and Engineering Systems
](https://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses_doc/){:target="\_blank"}
and [Statistics](https://stat.mit.edu/academics/idps/){:target="\_blank"}
from [IDSS](https://idss.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"} and
the [Statistics and Data Science Center](https://stat.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"}
at MIT, under the supervision of [Prof.  Pentland](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/sandy/overview/){:target="\_blank"}
and [Prof. Eckles](https://www.deaneckles.com/){:target="\_blank"}. 


My PhD research is focused on micro-level structural factors, such as network structure,
that contribute to unequal distribution of resources or information. As a computational
social scientist, I use methods from network science, statistics, experiment design and
causal inference. I am also interested in understanding the collective behavior in
institutional settings, the institutional mechanisms that promote cooperative behavior in
networks, or in contrast lead to unequal outcomes for different groups.

In a previous life, I worked at Google New York City as a software engineer from
2011 to 2015. At Google, I worked on several products around the AdWords ad auction. We
analyzed the ad auction dynamics and developed relevant suggestions for advertisers.
I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science both from the
University of Michigan - Ann Arbor.
