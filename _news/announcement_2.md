The prevalence of strong and long-ragne ties in social networks

***

Recent work suggest the existence of social ties that are both strong and connect
individuals from very different communities. We evaluate the prevalence of such ties
and identify basic characteristics of individuals with such rare ties.

We are also looking at the relationship between aggregate frequency of these ties and
economic outcomes.
