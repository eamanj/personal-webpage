  title={Network Structure of Unequal Diffusion},
  author={Jahani, Eaman and Eckles, Dean, and Pentland, Alex},
	abstract={
	We develop a theoretical network model that captures the network structure of unequal
	diffusion.  First, we argue that homophily alone does not fully
	explain the extent of unequal diffusion in the network.  We show that any departure from
	the uniform distribution of links to information sources among members of a group limits
	the diffusion of information to the group as a whole. The variation from equal
	opportunity baseline not only has first order effects since some individuals will have
	fewer direct links to information sources, but also second order effects as the whole
	group will have fewer diffusion paths to the information sources.  Second, we show
	empirically that most networks exhibit higher susceptibility to unequal diffusion across
	various grouping variables (e.g. gender or race) than expected simply by measures of
	homophily. Finally, we develop a variant of the Stochastic Block Model that
	parameterizes the cross-group linking of each node and by doing so fits not only
	assortativity on paths of length 1, but also diffusion assortativity on paths of
	length 2 and 3.

  author={Jahani, Eaman and Bailey, Michael and Eckles, Dean},
	abstract={
		We contribute to the literature on network structure and performance by studying the
		local network structure around individuals with the best outcomes. We propose the
		concept of bandwidth-diversity matching, according to which individuals who match
		the tie strength to their contacts with their structural novelty achieve truly
		diverse networks and obtain better outcomes. We investigate this in the context of
		birthday fundraisers on Facebook. We show that users whose networks is composed of
		a mixture of short embedded ties and long ties are more likely to reach their
		fundraiser goal than those with one type exclusively. More importantly, the
		stronger the long ties are, the more successful the campaign will be. In other
		words, the most successful fundraisers occur when the ego has cultivated a mix of
		embedded ties and strong-long ties.},

  author={Jahani, Eaman and Eckles, Dean},
	abstract={
		We examine the network mechanisms that widen inter-group differences and lead to different
		levels of  social capital in different groups. We study an information sharing game, in
		which individuals have to compete for a rivalrous resource over repeated rounds. The
		equilibrium predicts lower cooperation among lower status agents, which leads the whole
		group to receive a small share of the common resource. We further validate this
		prediction in an online lab experiment by recruiting individuals to play an online
		collaborative game in which they have to find and dig gold mines and in the process can
		pass information to their neighbors according to the network structure. The players
		which had a lower chance of receiving the gold were less likely to share it with their
		contacts. As a result, these low status players took ``a smaller share of the pie'' than
		what was expected by their individual differences.

 abstract={
	 Social networks play a predominant role in determining how information spreads between
	 individuals. Previous works suggest that long ties, which connect people who do not
	 share any mutual contact, provide access to valuable information on economic
	 opportunities. However, no population-scale study has determined how long ties relate
	 to economic outcomes and how such ties are formed. Using a novel dataset from
	 Facebook, we reconstruct the network of interactions between users and we uncover a
	 strong relationship between the share of long ties and economic outcomes at the local
	 level in the United States and in Mexico. Administrative units with a higher
	 proportion of long ties have higher incomes, higher economic mobility, lower
	 unemployment rates and higher wealth, even after adjusting for potential confounders
	 of these outcomes. In contrast to the weak tie theory, we find that having stronger
	 long ties is associated with better economic outcomes. Furthermore, we discover that
	 users with a higher proportion of long ties are more likely to have migrated between
	 US states, to have transferred to a different high school, and to have attended
	 college outside of their home state. Taken together, these results suggest that long
	 ties contribute to economic prosperity and highlight the role played by disruptive
	 life events in the formation of these ties.},

	member of the opposing party. Prior to this task, we exposed respondents to primes
	about a) a common enemy (involving threats from Iran, China, and Russia); b) a
	patriotic event; or c) a neutral, apolitical prime. Though we observed no
	significant differences in the behavior of Democrats as a result of these primes, we

  abstract = {In this paper, we argue that WhatsApp can play an important role in correcting misinformation. We show how specific WhatsApp affordances (flexibility in format and audience selection) and existing social capital (prevalence of strong ties; homophily in political groups) can be leveraged to maximize the re-sharing of debunking messages, such as those accessed by WhatsApp users via ChatBots and Tip-Lines. Debunking messages received in the format of audio files generated more interest and were more effective in correcting beliefs than text- or image-based messages. In addition, we found clear evidence that users re-share debunks at higher rates when they received them from people close to them (strong ties), from individuals who generally agree with them politically (in-group members), or when both conditions are met. We suggest that WhatsApp leverages our findings to maximize the re-share of those fact-checks that are already circulating on the platform by using the existing social capital in the network, unlocking the potential for such debunks to reach a larger audience on WhatsApp.},

Using a novel dataset from a major cryptocurrency forum, we conduct an exploratory study of the characteristics of online discussion around cryptocurrencies. Through a regression analysis, we find that coins with more information available and higher levels of technical innovation are associated with higher quality discussion. People who talk about "serious" coins tend to participate in discussion displaying signatures of collective intelligence and information processing, while people who talk about "less serious" coins tend to display signatures of hype and na\"{\i}vety. Interviews with experienced forum members also confirm these quantitative findings. These results highlight the varied roles of discussion in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and suggest that discussion of serious coins may be oriented towards earnest, perhaps more accurate, attempts at discovering which coins are likely to succeed.},

	abstract = {Mobile phones are one of the fastest growing technologies in the developing
	world with global penetration rates reaching 90\%. Mobile phone data, also called CDR,
	are generated everytime phones are used and recorded by carriers at scale. CDR have
	generated groundbreaking insights in public health, official statistics, and
	logistics. However, the fact that most phones in developing countries are prepaid
	means that the data lacks key information about the user, including gender and other
	demographic variables. This precludes numerous uses of this data in social science
	and development economic research. It furthermore severely prevents the development
	of humanitarian applications such as the use of mobile phone data to target aid
	towards the most vulnerable groups during crisis. We developed a framework to
	extract more than 1400 features from standard mobile phone data and used them to
	predict useful individual characteristics and group estimates. We here present a
	systematic cross-country study of the applicability of machine learning for dataset
	augmentation at low cost. We validate our framework by showing how it can be used to
	reliably predict gender and other information for more than half a million people in
	two countries. We show how standard machine learning algorithms trained on only
	10,000 users are sufficient to predict individual’s gender with an accuracy ranging
	from 74.3 to 88.4\% in a developed country and from 74.5 to 79.7\% in a developing
	country using only metadata. This is significantly higher than previous approaches
	and, once calibrated, gives highly accurate estimates of gender balance in groups.
	Performance suffers only marginally if we reduce the training size to 5,000, but
	significantly decreases in a smaller training set. We finally show that our
	indicators capture a large range of behavioral traits using factor analysis and that
	the framework can be used to predict other indicators of vulnerability such as age
	or socio-economic status. Mobile phone data has a great potential for good and our
	framework allows this data to be augmented with vulnerability and other information
	at a fraction of the cost.},

We hypothesize these results are due to concentrated distribution of economic opportunities among the highly educated social strata combined with homophily among members of the same group.
