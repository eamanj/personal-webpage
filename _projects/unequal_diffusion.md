In this project, we propose a random network model that illustrates how brokerage in
network structure can lead to unequal diffusion. Furthermore, we present empirical results
that confirm the role of brokerage in constraining information diffusion in real-world
networks. Network  brokerage occurs when a few nodes in the network have higher
propensity  to connect with an out-group than other in-group nodes. While brokers play an
integral role in connecting otherwise disconnected communities across structural holes [1],
they can nevertheless act as a bottleneck when compared to a similar network with
cross-group ties uniformly distributed across the network. Because brokers hold a
disproportionate number of cross-group ties,  they can constrain diffusion of information
from one group to another.

To completely account for unequal diffusion in a network, one needs to not only look at
homophily or assortativity on paths of length 1, but also on the extent of assortativity
of all possible diffusion paths of varying length.  Here, we show brokerage can increase
assortativity along diffusion paths of length 2 in ways that simple measures of homophily
fail to capture. Any variation in cross-group linking among nodes of a group leads to
higher unequal diffusion than expected by models that explicitly fit assortativity
[2]. As the first step, we show this phenomena analytically by building a latent space
network model [3] with a parameter that controls the degree of heterogeneity in
cross-group linking. Figure 1 shows what happens as we modify this parameter: while
assortativity along paths of length 1 decreases as cross-type edges appear, assortativity
along paths of length 2, akin to diffusion assortativity, can remain high if the network
exhibits high brokerage.

Figure 1. Assortativity along paths of length 1 and 2 vary as the distribution of nodes on
the latent space varies. Each point corresponds to a network model as we vary the latent
space distribution. Different colors correspond to varying levels of brokerage. For a
fixed level of assortativity on paths of length 1, as brokerage increases, assortativity
on paths of length 2 also increases.

As the second step, we investigate the extent of this phenomena in real-world networks. We
find that most networks exhibit higher susceptibility to unequal diffusion than expected
by simple measures of homophily across various grouping variables (e.g. gender or race).
Finally, we develop a variant of the Stochastic Block Model [4] that parametrizes the
cross-group degree of each node, and by doing so fits not only assortativity on paths of
length 1, but also assortativity on paths of length 2 and 3. This model significantly
improves the fit over SBM on empirical networks and accurately predicts the susceptibility
of a network to unequal diffusion. For example, Figure 2 shows how the observed
assortativity along paths of length 2 compares against the regular degree-corrected SBM
model versus our model which accounts for brokers.

Figure 2. Top row shows the observed assortativity on paths of length 2 versus its
distribution from the MLE of the degree-corrected Stochastic Block Model (DC-SBM). The
assortativity is measured along gender in two middle school networks. Bottom row
illustrates the same comparison in our model which accounts for cross-group degree
variation or brokerage. In total, 30% of our school networks have higher assortativities
than expected by DC-SBM, whereas none of the networks have this inconsistency under our
model.

Our modeling results show that networks that have similar levels of assortativity or
homophily could have very different degrees of susceptibility to unequal diffusion. This
variation arises from the extent to which the connections between different social
classes are controlled by a small group of individuals acting as brokers. Our findings
provide an important policy implication: while brokers act as a bridge between
communities, they nevertheless control the flow of information. Networks that heavily
depend on brokers for connectivity suffer from unequal diffusion of information much
greater than networks whose cross-group links are equally distributed. This happens
because the existence of brokers not only hampers diffusion to the first degree but also
to the second degree, the whole group ends up with less pathways to information sources.
