Debunk campaigns that harness the existing social capital
or dyadic trust in the social network can be more effective in belief change than simple
broadcast messages by authorities or experts. In this project, we
discuss how debunk messages shared via Mobile Instant Messaging (MIM) Apps are likely to be perceived and what makes
them more likely to be reshared. Through a randomized survey experiment, we find that
debunk messages are more likely to be reshared if they come from a strong tie or an in-group
member.
Our experiment tests how the following three factors contribute to successful fact-checking
and dissemination of debunk messages:
1. *Correction Format:* Given that interest has been shown to be a factor in increasing
messages shareability [1], richer, audio and image-based formats would be more interesting
than text-based formats, and that this should result in greater belief change.
2. *Relational Closeness of Source:* Given that strong ties are generally considered more
credible [2], fact-checks shared via MIMs that come from strong ties should be more
persuasive than weak ties because strong ties are more trustworthy.
3. *Attitudinal Similarity of Source:* Given that messages become more persuasive when
they are offered by someone apparently speaking against their self-interests [3], and that
attitude homophily has been shown to increase perceived source credibility [4], debunks to
pro-attitudinal false claims shared by an in-group member (same party affiliation) should
have larger effects on beliefs.

Figure 1 shows how the quality of the tie from whom the correction originates interacts
with effectiveness of the debunk message. The debunk messages which originate from strong
ties or in-group are significantly more likely to be reshared (p < 0.05, N=717). An
ordered logistic regression model with 5 categories for intention to share also reveals
that strong-ingroup ties have the largest effect on intention to share while weak-outgroup
ties have the smallest effect on shareability. We also find that voice correction formats
lead to larger effects on both belief change and intention to share (p < 0.05, N=717)
compared to text and image format. These effects are robust under various model
formulations or dependent variable specifications, as long as the model controls for
perceived credibility of the debunk message.
